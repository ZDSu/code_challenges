"""
Write a function that wil take 3 arguments:
bombs = list of bomb locations
rows, columns
mine_sweeper([[0,0], [1,2], 3, 4])

bomb at row index 0 column index 0
bomb at row index 0 column index 1
3 rows
3 columns

we should return a 3 x 4 array (-1) = bomb
(ends up deleting this) [[-1, -1, 1, 0], [2, 2, 1, 0], the 2 bombs means 2 bombs in surrounding cells [1,0] knows [0,0] and [0,1] have    0,0,0,0]]
