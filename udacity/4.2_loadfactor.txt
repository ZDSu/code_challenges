1. One of your coworkers comes to you with a hash function that divides a group of values by 100, and uses the remainder as a key. The values are 100 numbers that are all multiples of 5. What is the load factor?

2. He thinks it's a little slow--what number would you recommend his function to divide by rather than 100 to speed it up?
a. 87
b. 125
c. 107
d. 1001

Answers:
1. 1 [For the load factor, divide the number of values by the number of buckets]
2. c [125 is also a multiple of 5, which will cause a lot of collisions; 87 is better but since it is less than 100, there will still be collisions; 1001 is good but will create many leftover buckets and waste memory]
